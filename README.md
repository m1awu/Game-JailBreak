<h1> JailBreak </h1>
<p> JailBreak is a role-playing game where the player interacts by becoming Jack Wellington, an infamous bomb artist, that needs to escape his confinement in Essex Jail. However, it won't be as simple as it may seem, due to countless bosses (a.k.a. guards) trying to weaken you and return you back to your "oh-so cozy" cell.</p>
